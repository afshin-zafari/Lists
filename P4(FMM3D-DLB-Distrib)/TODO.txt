* PUMA-FM
	o Setup in Tintin
	o Problem setup
* Read Problem Setup from file
	o Read points
	o Construct tree
	o Read operators
* New gemv functions for Si handles
	o WITH_DUCTTEIP compile flag
	o WITH_DLB compile flag
	o Si owner, child index, offset from first member in level
* Partitioning ? 
o DuctTeip changes
	* DTData <--SGMatrix
	* glbCtx.Data <-- DTData
	* Turn off mem alloc / mem pool in ductteip
	* Set memory info for data : addr, Len, leading dim
	* GetContentAddr and getHeaderAddr to be changed
	* FMMContext
	* runKernels: t->run
	* DTData
	* Optim Comm
	* Task type, 
		* Arg 1: M2M/T, index
		* Arg 2: S/O, Level, group
		* Arg 3: S/O, Level, group
	* Task pack/unpack
	* SGTaskGemv <-- received task
	* getDatabyhandle-->use vector vs. list search
	* when data received, if current version is being used, the data to be copied to a spare memory
	* Unit Tests
		o Simple Problem setup
			* Tree is ok: L, #groups in l, groups in l
			* Operators are ok, M,T,V : #,MxN , 
			* sum(abs(M read)) = sum(abs(M expectd))
			* Points in boxes are ok #Box, #Pi in Bi
			* Charges are initialzed ok : #X, sum(abs(Xi))=sum(abs(X exp))
		o Si Oj ownership Works
		o Task ownership works 
		o Send and receive data work
		o Export import task works
	o Migrated task runs ok
	o Near field works
	o Far field works
	o DLB works
